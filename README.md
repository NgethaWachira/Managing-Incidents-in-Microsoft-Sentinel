# Objective
To explain the process of triaging, investigating, and responding to incidents in Microsoft Sentinel, focusing on the steps involved in managing incidents, prioritizing them based on severity, using investigation tools (such as visualizations and timelines), assigning tasks, running automation rules, and collaborating with teams through Microsoft Teams. Emphasizing key actions like adjusting incident severity, tracking progress, handling tasks, investigating IPs, and ultimately responding to and closing incidents after taking necessary actions.

## Skills Learned
- Incident Management and Prioritization: Learned how to manage and view security incidents, adjust timeframes, assess and prioritize incidents based on severity, and modify severity levels when necessary to ensure critical incidents are addressed first.

- Gained expertise in investigating incidents by analyzing key details such as entities involved, tactics, techniques, IP addresses, and timelines. Use Sentinelâ€™s investigation features, including visualizations, queries, and real-time log monitoring, to track activities and understand the scope of incidents.

- Task Assignment and Tracking: Developed the ability to assign and track tasks within an investigation, monitor progress, and ensure completion of required actions. Tasks can be marked off as completed once finished.

- Collaboration and Team Management: Used Microsoft Teams to create teams, collaborate on incidents, and coordinate responses. Share information and manage discussions to ensure efficient team-based decision-making.

- Automation and Playbook Execution: Understood how to run automated playbooks and create automation rules to streamline responses and alleviate manual tasks, improving future incident management.

- Incident Closure and Classification: Learned the process for closing incidents, assigning classifications, and ensuring all response actions have been completed and documented.
